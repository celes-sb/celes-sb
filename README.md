### Hello, stranger! 👽 Welcome to my GitHub :)

I am glad the algorithm brought you here. My name is <b>Celeste S. Bareiro</b> but you can call me <b>C or Celes</b> ;)
I am a Full Stack Developer graduated from 4Geeks Academy. I was born and raised in Argentina 🇦🇷 and I am currently located in Buenos Aires 🧉. 
I am a very creative person and I found that what I love the most about coding is to be able to give form to very cool ideas that almost look like magic 🪄


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project to build a platform for an Argentinian movement coach.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I’ve been learning how to be a project leader during the duration of my last project and all that it entitles.
- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate on environmental and conservation projects to give back to Mother Earth.
- 🤔 I’m looking to deepen my knowledge of integrating front and and back end.
- 🫀 Pronouns: she/her
- 🕶️ Fun fact: I express myself mainly through movement so you can always find me moving my body in all ways possible even if I am in front of the computer. Pretzel developer? 🥨 possibly!
- 💬 Ask me about anything here 👉 LinkedIn or Email.
